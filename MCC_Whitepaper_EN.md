# Mammoth Casino Chain

## 1. Abstract

### 1.1 What we are?

Mammoth Casino Chain is an upcoming decentralized game platform that adopts MCT as its token and where individual users can obtain rewards they deserve at the time of playing recreational games. In addition, such rewards are valuable. Platform development was fulfilled based on the Ethereum smart contract with which players are involved. Such a platform plays a role of controlling quantities of tokens issued and improving functions of the smart contract. Players are permitted to access the Ethereum contract address to recharge Ethers; in this way, they can acquire tokens of the corresponding values. After
that, players make use of the existing tokens to play the game and spend their tokens. As far as progress of the development is concerned, other functions that come into play when a player takes part in the game platform can be realized in the future. For example, the Oracle function is utilized to make the change of tokens into real assets between users come true.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Why take the lead in entering the game market?

A report published by Atomico, a venture capital firm in London, indicates that output value of the global game industry has broken through $ 100 billion for the first time in 2016. According to this report,data growth in American and European game markets is accompanied with the confidence of investors. As predicted by Atomico, output value of the global game industry in 2017 will arrive at 109 billion, 42% of which is derived from mobile games; by 2020, such a value will reach 129 billion and the percent taken by mobile games will turn into 51% that exceeds proportions occupied by output values generated by traditional game platforms such as PC game and video game consoles, etc.. Such a prediction signifies that the mobile game is bound to subvert game products in the near future.

### 2.2 Why take the lead in combining mobile gambling?

Mobile gambling is becoming a very popular game mode. Based on it, a great number of people are able to find a convenient and relaxed way of entertainment and gain opportunities to get the best earnings for them. Considering that we can play Zynga Slots, roulette, the 21 point and other games by virtue of mobile gambling, it is certain that players would love to spend time to join such recreational activities.

In the past, a player can play a game after he/she exchanges the money for tokens on a recharge platform to spend these tokens or earn tokens. However, it is generally impossible for the player to withdraw the token or make it realized, which troubles the user to a certain degree. Under this circumstance, a kind of third-party trading platform emerges and plays two roles of guarantor and server during transaction. In this case, the user fails to obtain cash exchanged within a short time and the platform itself also cannot deal with disputes incurred in the process of transaction. Thanks to Oracle,such disputes can be dissolved. On the premise of guaranteeing transaction security, the player makes use of the Oracle to realize his/her tokens at short notice. Additionally, Oracle also supports token transactions between players.

## 3. Market survey

Block chain makes it possible for payments and deposit withdrawal on a game platform and investors of the block chain will put the investment into the game platform. Appreciation of Mammoth Casino Chain is maintained with the growth of community users. It is estimated that revenues of the global gaming industry can exceed $ 450 billion in 2015 and the size of on-line gambling market around the globe arrives at  47.1 billion approximately. In addition, many BTC or the so-called crypt currency transactions are associated with gambling at present according to the information. Considering this, an idea occurs to us that the token can be applied into more platforms.

## 4. Common problems encountered with in real life and solutions to them

### 4.1 Problems &solutions

#### 4.1.1 Problems

Regarding traditional online businesses, they are centralized, which means that it is much likely for them to suffer hacker attacks, tax rates required and supervisions, etc. so that free development of the industry is obstructed. By contrast, decentralization can be adopted to let such businesses run more freely, protect investors or users, make people enjoy the full freedom and reduce burdens incurred by other supervision approaches and taxes and dues, etc..

Shortcomings of the traditional centralized recharge market are as follows.

* After recharging an account by virtue of another platform, the fund cannot be guaranteed to be transferred to the corresponding account simultaneously. Or, the player has no confidence in such a recharge platform.
* In the case that we change tokens for cashes, the fund cannot be guaranteed to be transferred to the corresponding account smoothly.
* The player is unable to control its own game account.
* The player is permitted for token exchange within a fixed time frame.

#### 4.1.2 Solutions

Our Mammoth Casino Chain token is a kind of decentralized token realized based on Ethereum smart contract and has the following features.

* The player is able to control tokens in its own account completely.
* No fraudulent conduct of false recharge platform exists.
* No hidden service charges are required.
* Game operating costs can be reduced.
* It is game developer friendly.

## 5. Framework & interface

### 5.1 Framework introduction

The entire framework of MCT is designed into three layers,including a driver layer, a proxy layer and an application layer.

Driver layer is the core of the complete system; it adopts an Ethereum block chain technology and the smart contract and plays a role of preserving user tokens. As for all token transactions among users, they can be fulfilled based on the Ethereum network.

On the proxy layer, game platform takes the place of the user to perform game token recharge. In addition, there is no need for the user to conduct token conversion at the time of recharging with Ethers. However,when user buy tokens with cryptocurrency such as BTC and LTC, or legal tender,system will exchange these currency into Ethers and recharge at a certain rate;moreover, these Ethers are recharged into user’s  Ethereum account.Subsequently, the user is substituted by the platform that buys certain game tokens to fulfill the transaction.

The application layer can be described as follows. In the case that an MCT based game is being developed by a game developer, it only needs to access our application interface to use MCT; or, as supported by smart contract, third-party game tokens can be generated. Such an entirely transparent and open process is completed based on Ethereum smart contract.

### 5.2 Token Usage

Capital mortgage is not required for the user. When he/she needs to buy any token, the Ethereum account should be adopted to transfer a certain number of Ethers to the MCT address and these Ethers are then converted into a certain amount of tokens used as game currency of the user in the process of playing games. In addition, the user is also permitted to convert such Ethers on an exchange platform into physical commodities or membership cards. Thus,tokens of the user become valuable and it is then necessary for them to circulate.

### 5.3 Reserved developer interface

1. Game developers can connect our MCT to use it in a direct manner, which spares many development procedures.
2. By selecting our token contract, the game developer can produce its own third-party tokens. As for the conversion between third-party tokens and MCT, there exists a formula and the exchange ratio can be determined according to the market price. We will supervise contracts of third-party tokens on line to realize the conversion between tokens employed by different game developers and make it convenient for players to transfer their tokens between diverse games.

## 6. Utilization of Ethereum and contribution to Ethereum

### 6.1 Ethereum P2P network

P2P network is a point-to-point network serving as an application framework that can be utilized to realize mutual communication among members and work allocation, etc.. Regarding Mammoth Casino Chain, it makes use of a distributed protocol in Ethereum to support running of the entire smart contract and ecology. We should express our gratitude to Ethereum blockchain that spares our time spent on developing the bottom layer of the blockchain.

### 6.2 Contribution to be made by us-the mobile-terminal node 

Currently, a majority of applications take advantage of PC-terminal nodes. In addition to occasional inconvenience, many light wallets only link to a remote PC-terminal node. As a consequence, the mobile-terminal node is not implemented in a true sense and they also access the Ethereum network simultaneously. Our platform is a mobile terminal based platform, according to which, mobile terminal APP can directly access the Ethereum network without running other PC-terminal servers. In this way, the platform becomes more efficient. With the gradual progress of development, token exchange is realized by accessing PC platform; in turn, the APP directly access the major Ethereum network with the help of such a platform further responsible for spreading transactions in the Ethereum network, which is beneficial for fast propagation of Ethereum transactions.

## 7. ERC20 token & account

The token openly converted by Mammoth Casino Chain is referred to as Mammoth Casino Chain Token (MCT), which is realized based on the ERC20 token standard of Ethereum. Many functions have been implemented by us,including “token standardization”, “Ethereum account hosting” and “virtual asset  register” and so on.

### 7.1 ERC20 token introduction

As a token standard based on Ethereum smart contract, ERC20 Token Standard has been recognized by the Ethereum community and widely applied. Likewise, MCT is developed by the standard interface of ERC20 to guarantee both security and universality of MCT.

Inquire address for tokens developed based on the ERC20 standard is as follows: [https://etherscan.io/token-search](https://etherscan.io/token-search).

### 7.2 Introduction to account operations by the user

Token transactions can be carried out in line with three approaches below.

1. Exchange. The user takes advantage of its Ether account in the exchange to purchase tokens and perform token transactions. The exchange has a high level of security and can replace the user to keep tokens.
2. On our token transaction platform, tokens can be bought or sold; at the same time, they can be utilized to exchange for some physical commodities. 
3. Official wallet of the Ethereum is permitted to participate into token transactions provided that the smart contract address and interface of the corresponding MCT have been added.

## 8. Ecological chain planning for Mammoth Casino Chain

### 8.1 Role of effect of the user

#### 8.1.1 Role of the user

Tokens of Mammoth Casino Chain plays an extremely key role in ecological economy of MCT and users of tokens also have diverse roles to play.

* Player
* Game developer
* Transaction platform operator

#### 8.1.2 Effects of different users

1. Player 

The player can play all games that support tokens of Mammoth Casino Chain. In these games, such tokens are in common use, which saves a lot of trouble and can facilitate the inter flow among game tokens adopted by different game developers. The player is permitted to freely buy tokens or sell them to platform contract to get some Ethers in return.

2. Game developer

There is no need for any game developer to write an extra token system; it can directly interconnect with the Ethereum network by virtue of the Mammoth Casino Chain token; in addition, after recharge on the game platform, the user can change its money into tokens of the corresponding value.

3. Transaction platform operator

Price of the token can fluctuate together with the market quotation. Besides, the user is permitted to sell virtual objects in the game at auction to acquire tokens of the corresponding value. In this way, many games turn into real money based games.

### 8.2 Planning perspectives

Vision of Mammoth Casino Chain is to provide a game and recreational platform to community users who can enter the community by purchasing assets. On one hand, asset price can go up continuously; on the other hand, the number of platform users can keep rising, which may be followed by unceasing increase in quantities of players of the game developer.

## 9. Functions and characteristics of token

### 9.1 Token transaction function

1. After the game accesses our token system, the player can recharge the token by a decentralized Ethereum network. Not only is the entire recharging process open and transparent, but transaction records can be checked. At the same time, token exchanged for is transferred to the account within 1 minute.
2. Players of the same game can perform token transaction in a direct manner within the token system; meanwhile, corresponding transactions are updated in the block chain system that guarantees real-time transparency and openness of token transactions. 
3. Virtual objects in the game can be put on the platform for auction by the player, while other players select those they want to buy on this platform. In return, the seller acquires tokens correspondingly.

### 9.2 Blacklist

Players may find themselves in such a situation usually. Some players may viciously interfere with justice and equity of the game or even speak maliciously. Specific to such occasions, a blacklist mechanism has been established by us. When any user violates game rules in the process of playing the game, the game is able to add such a player into a blacklist in consistency with the relevant rules. For players that have been put into the blacklist,they can no longer use their game tokens that have been locked within a certain period until the locking time is over. Function of locking is recorded into the Ethereum block chain in real time so as to effectively maintain fairness of the game.

### 9.3 Special functions

1. At the time of realizing token selling/buying among players, the platform also supports users to exchange their tokens for legal tender by virtue of Oracle that serves as a node and a platform simultaneously,which can realize the change of token into legal tender for users.
2. Many games can turn into real money based games to attract more players, make such games more valuable, and keep the steady growth of their market prices. For example, equipment of a game can be exchanged for with tokens. Considering that tokens are of value and related to real money,the game becomes a real money based game.
3. In the near future, APP will directly access the major Ethereum network to act as the mobile-terminal node of Ethereum. In this way, APP takes the responsibility to spread transactions in the Ethereum network,which is beneficial for fast propagation of such transactions.
4. A contract in charge of supervising out MCT tokens and other game tokens will be put on line by us to realize conversion between different tokens and further make it convenient for players to convert game tokens.

## 10. Surrounding ecology &vision of application

### 10.1 Our present ecology

#### 10.1.1 Game App

First APP published by us falls into the category of gambling and trial game of this APP will be pushed before ICO. Subsequently, we will link to more game developers. During game, you can use tokens to play; and, in the APP launched by us for the first time, you are permitted to play Baccarat, a game originating in France and becoming popular in all large casinos in Europe later. Or, you can play Caribbean Stud Poker that requires no gambling among players who only need to play against the banker. As estimated by us, the advantage occupied by the banker of such a game is only 5% approximately. Or,you can play the widespread 21 Point that originates in France and becomes globally popular afterwards. If you do not play poker games, try Slots and other games.

#### 10.1.2 Platform of point redeeming

Plat form of point redeeming is a transaction platform based on Ethereum smart contract. It adopts the Oracle technology to fill in the gap between smart contract and real assets. As far as the real assets are concerned, it is rather difficult to perform anchoring between tokens and them. For this reason, we put such a platform on line. On the platform of point redeeming, the user can exchange tokens for physical commodities they want in a direct manner, which is as secure and effective as token transactions on other platforms. Moreover, we are the first to cooperate with Netflix, Starbucks, Spotify, Amazon and iTunes. Firstly,the platform will be built in the first cooperative game APP by us to realize material object exchange. In this platform, you can exchange your tokens for Netflix gift cards, Starbucks gift cards, Spotify gift cards, Amazon gift cards, iTunes gift cards or other products of different values correspondingly.

### 10.2 Our future ecology

#### 10.2.1 Linking to more games and game developers

According to our plan, we will connect with more game developers in the future, not just those of gambling games included. We also hope to reach a cooperation relation with more varieties of game developers to realize inter flow of tokens among various game developers together with revenue and resource sharing.

#### 10.2.2 Exchange

From the 4th quarter of 2017 to the 1st quarter of 2018, there will be at least 2 transaction platforms going on line according to the plan. We deem that more transaction platforms going on line mean that more players will be attracted so that our game developers can make a profit, value of our tokens keeps steady and it becomes less likely for their prices to be manipulated.  

#### 10.2.3 Wallet App

We will develop lightweight and mobile-terminal wallets in the future. Hopefully,players are able to use our tokens in a more convenient and efficient manner.Furthermore, it is quite possible for such wallets to be applied into real life. Considering this, our ultimate goal is to adopt tokens to pay daily expenditures.

#### 10.2.4 Mortgage place establish 

In the future, we will launch a mortgage place application. All Ethereum based tokens with active trade can be mortgaged for MCT, and the mortgage exchange ratio will be decided by real time market value of both token and MCT. As soon as we get other tokens, we will sell them immediately and meantime buy MCT from market to fill the gap caused by mortgage.
